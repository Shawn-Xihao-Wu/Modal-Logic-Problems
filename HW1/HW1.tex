1. Call a binary relation $R$ on a set $S$ \emph{asymmetric} if for no $a,b \in S$ 
both $\langle a, b \rangle \in R$ and $\langle b, a \rangle \in R$. Specify a 
relation $R$ and a set $S$ such that $R$ is a relation on $S$ and $R$ is reflexive 
and asymmetric. 
\newpage
\noindent
2. Prove that the transitive closure, $R^+$ of a binary relation $R$ is actually 
transitive. You can do this however you like. Here is one suggestion:
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\alph{enumi}.}
\item Prove that, where $X$ is a set and $R \subseteq X^2$ (i.e.,\ it is a binary 
relation on $X$), then $\langle a,b \rangle \in R^n$ (as defined on page 191 of 
your text) iff there is a path of length $n$ between $a$ and $b$ in the graph of 
$R$. 
\item Use this result to then argue that if $\langle a,b\rangle \in R^+$ and $\
langle b,c\rangle \in R^+$, then $\langle a,c\rangle \in R^+$.
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
\noindent
3. Let $R \subseteq X^2$ be a binary relation on $X$ that is antisymmetric, 
transitive and total/connex (notice that totality implies reflexivity). Show that 
$$R' := \{\langle x,y \rangle \in X^2: \langle y, x \rangle \notin R\}$$
\noindent
is irreflexive, transitive, and connected/semi-connex. (A relation on $X$  is \
emph{connected}, or \emph{semi-connex}, if, for all $x,y \in X$, if $x\neq y$ then 
either $\langle x, y \rangle \in R$ or $\langle y, x \rangle \in R$. A relation 
is \emph{connex}, or \emph{total}, when, for all $x,y \in X$, either $\langle x, 
y \rangle \in R$ or $\langle y, x \rangle \in R$.)
\newpage
\noindent
4. Call a relation $R$ on a set $S$ \emph{universal} when, for all $x, y \in S$, $\
langle x, y \rangle \in R$. Let $R$ be an equivalence relation and define, for each
$x \in S$, the set 
$$[x] = \{y \in S : \langle x , y \rangle \in R\}$$
\noindent
Call this the \emph{equivalence class} of $x$ (with respect to $R$). Prove that all
of the following are true:
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\alph{enumi}.}
\item $x \in [x]$, for all $x \in S$;
\item $R$ is universal on each equivalence class $[x]$;
\item Every element of $S$ is in one and only one equivalence class.
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
\noindent
5. Prove that the set $\{\neg, \land, \lor\}$ is truth-functionally complete. Hint:
Consider the following truth table for some arbitrary binary connective $\circ$:
\medskip
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc|c}
$\varphi$ & $\psi$ & $\varphi \circ \psi$ \\ \hline
$\mathsf{t}$ & $\mathsf{t}$ & $\mathsf{v}_1$ \\
$\mathsf{t}$ & $\mathsf{f}$ & $\mathsf{v}_2$ \\
$\mathsf{f}$ & $\mathsf{t}$ & $\mathsf{v}_3$ \\
$\mathsf{f}$ & $\mathsf{f}$ & $\mathsf{v}_4$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\medskip
\noindent
where $\mathsf{v}_i$ is the truth value for that row. There are at least two 
options now.  One is a brute force argument that is effective, but not so exciting.
See if you can come up with a different one. Start by thinking about what you could
do if all the values are $\mathsf{f}$. What would express such a function? Then 
think about what would happen if one of the values were $\mathsf{t}$. How might you
express that? Then go from there\dots
